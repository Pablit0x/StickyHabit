# StickyHabit App Concept

## Purpose
The **StickyHabit** app is designed to help users create a positive change in their lives by focusing on the modification and management of their habits. Drawing inspiration from the principles outlined in the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, this app aims to assist users in identifying, tracking, and transforming their habits over time.

## Functionality

### Habit Listing
- Users can list and categorize their habits into 'good' and 'bad' to gain clarity and awareness of their daily routines.

### Habit Replacement
- For every bad habit listed, the app encourages the user to specify a positive habit they wish to adopt in its place, facilitating a seamless transition.

### Integration and Scheduling
- Users can specify a time and place for each good habit, linking it to an existing routine, which helps in creating a structured habit formation process.

### Progress Tracking
- The app provides progress tracking for each habit, offering insights and motivational feedback to keep users engaged and informed about their personal growth.
